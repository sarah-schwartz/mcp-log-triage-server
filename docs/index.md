# Log Triage MCP Server

This documentation covers the MCP server used to triage local log files. It
exposes one primary tool (`triage_logs`), a small set of resources, and a few
workflow prompts.

## What You Can Do

- Filter large logs by time window, severity, and substring
- Parse multiple formats without pre-conversion
- Fetch resource content over scoped URIs
- Use prompt templates for consistent triage outputs
- Optionally review non-error signals with an AI pipeline
